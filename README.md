# On3WebScraper
Stores files that scrape the On3 website for data on the top 1000 recruits (according to the On3 composite), and their ratings from On3, 247, ESPN, and Rivals


When you open the .py file, scroll down to the bottom, and change the filename if you prefer to name it something other than what it is currently named.
Keep in mind that I may add my own "L" composite (that's the first letter of my name, not loss) and you may ignore that data as you wish. Data is directly copyable into an EXCEL file.
Thank you for reading

This data is also now ONLINE at lukednelson.com/ldnrecruits
